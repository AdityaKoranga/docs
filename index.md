# NgKore Documentation

NgKore is an open source community led by a
group of passionate researchers, engineers, and
professionals working to advance the future of 5G
Advanced and 6G technologies. Our work spans a wide
range of focus areas, including O-RAN,
Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), AI/ML integration,
Post-Quantum Cryptography adoption, blockchain
integration, and cloud-native telecom
infrastructure.
